Hybrid Move Benchmark
=====================

Benchmarks the time taken to move particles over a 2D domain on which domain decomposition is applied. 
This benchmark does no useful work and is a benchmark of the particle bookkeeping.

Requires NESO-Particles `NP`_.
See the `example_outputs` directory for cmake configuration and example launching.
